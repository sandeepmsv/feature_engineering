Life cycle of a Data Science Projects
1. Data Collectio Statergy(Pending topic for me) ----- from company side, 3rd party api's, Surveys
2. Features Engineering-------Handling Missing Values,


Why are their Missing values?? Survey--Depression Survey------
1. They hesitate to put down the information
2. survey informations are not valid
3. Men-----Salary
4. Women----age
5.People may have died ---NaN

Data Science Projects ---- Dataset should be collected from multiple sources

What are the different types of missing data?

Missing completely at Random, MCAR
A variable is missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of being missing is the same 
for all the observations. When data is MCAR, there is absoluetly no relationship between the missing
data and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing
data points are random subset of the data. There is nothing systemetic going on that makes some 
data more likely to be missing than other.

If values for observations are missing completely at random, then disregarding those cases would 
not bias the inferences made.

Data that will be missing------
1) Continous data











2) categorical data
